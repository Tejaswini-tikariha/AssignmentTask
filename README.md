Objective of the Task

Goal: Build a dynamic list in an Android application using modern development tools and
architecture.
Skills Assessed:
- Kotlin programming
- Data Binding implementation
- Retrofit for API handling
- MVVM architecture
- Coroutines for asynchronous tasks
- Attention to detail and clean code practices

Project Overview

Scenario: Create a list using data from a mock API.
Mock API URL: https://mocki.io/v1/39bc7786-3c3f-42c9-b815-a0ce7a6df9c7
Expected Outcome: A functional RecyclerView displaying API data using MVVM architecture.
Technologies to Use

- Kotlin: Primary programming language.
- Data Binding: For connecting XML and ViewModel seamlessly.
- Retrofit: API client for networking.
- MVVM Architecture: Ensures separation of concerns.

- Coroutines: Handles background tasks efficiently.

Mock API Details

API Endpoint: https://mocki.io/v1/39bc7786-3c3f-42c9-b815-a0ce7a6df9c7
Sample Response Format:
{
"id": 1, "name": "Item 1", "description": "Description 1"
"id": 2, "name": "Item 2", "description": "Description 2" }
Purpose: Fetch data to populate the list dynamically.

Project Requirements

Components to Implement:
- Model Class: Define data structure for the API response.
- Retrofit API Interface: Handle the API calls.
- Repository: Abstract data source logic.
- ViewModel: Manage data and business logic.
- RecyclerView Adapter: Display data in the list.
- Use Bottom Navigations.
- XML Layouts: Define the user interface.(use constraint layout).
